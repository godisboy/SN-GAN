    r"""Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size
    :math:`(N, C_{in}, H, W)` and output :math:`(N, C_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})`
    can be precisely described as:

    .. math::

        \begin{array}{ll}
        out(N_i, C_{out_j})  = bias(C_{out_j})
                       + \sum_{{k}=0}^{C_{in}-1} weight(C_{out_j}, k)  \star input(N_i, k)
        \end{array}

    where :math:`\star` is the valid 2D `cross-correlation`_ operator,
    :math:`N` is a batch size, :math:`C` denotes a number of channels,
    :math:`H` is a height of input planes in pixels, and :math:`W` is
    width in pixels.

    | :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
      number or a tuple.
    | :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
    |  sides for :attr:`padding` number of points for each dimension.
    | :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
      known as the Ã  trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this `link`_
      has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.
    | :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      `in_channels` and `out_channels` must both be divisible by `groups`.
    |       At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
    |       At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
                 layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
                 and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
                 concatenated.
            At groups=`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with its
                 own set of filters (of size `out_channels // in_channels`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    .. note::

         The configuration when `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels = K * in_channels`
         where `K` is a positive integer is termed in literature as depthwise convolution.

         In other words, for an input of size :math:`(N, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`, if you want a
         depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier `K`,
         then you use the constructor arguments
         :math:`(in\_channels=C_{in}, out\_channels=C_{in} * K, ..., groups=C_{in})`

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): Zero-padding added to both sides of the input. Default: 0
        dilation (int or tuple, optional): Spacing between kernel elements. Default: 1
        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input channels to output channels. Default: 1
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, adds a learnable bias to the output. Default: ``True``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})` where
          :math:`H_{out} = floor((H_{in}  + 2 * padding[0] - dilation[0] * (kernel\_size[0] - 1) - 1) / stride[0] + 1)`
          :math:`W_{out} = floor((W_{in}  + 2 * padding[1] - dilation[1] * (kernel\_size[1] - 1) - 1) / stride[1] + 1)`

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape
                         (out_channels, in_channels, kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1])
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape (out_channels)

        W(Tensor): Spectrally normalized weight

        u (Tensor): the right largest singular value of W.
